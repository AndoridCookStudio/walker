## Overview
I like hanging out with my friends without any plan. When I get hungry I use yelp or foursquare before. But there is too much information and also I wanted to make my decision by how foods are good in the restaurant.(I'm looking for nice meal. Not restaurant.) More visual, intuitive, fast, easy...Tinder!!
This is my experiment that using Tinder UI for food. You can fall in love with food! :)

This project is using [FourSqure api](https://ja.foursquare.com/developers/apps), [Facebook Login](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/android) and [Firebase](
https://firebase.google.com/) to save user's data.
